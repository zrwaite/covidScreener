Allows uwaterloo students to automatically complete their covid screening by forwarding the email with subject containing "Welcome to Campus - Please complete COVID-19 screening" to 3fsyu.covid@inbox.testmail.app 

By using this you agree you have said no to all of the screening questions, but are just annoyed at clicking through it every single day
